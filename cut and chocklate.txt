Cut the Chocolate
Dipen has a chocolate of N by M pieces. He and Damini started playing with this chocolate.

First Dipen takes the chocolate and divides it into two parts by making either a horizontal or a vertical cut. Then, Damini takes one of the available pieces and divides it into two parts by making either a horizontal or a vertical cut. Then Dipen do the same thing again and so on.

The player who cannot make a turn loses. When all pieces are of size 1 * 1 player can not make a turn.

Find who will win if both of them play optimally.

Input:

Two integers denoting N and M.
Output:

Single integer. 1 if Dipen is going to win, 0 if Damini is going to win.
Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^9
1 <= M <= 10^9
Example:

Input:
N = 1, M = 2

Output: 
1

Explanation:
There is only one possible move, so Damini even won't have a chance to make move.

...........................Algorithm......................
if product of (n*m) is return even return 1 else 0 .just think about it



int Solution::solve(int A, int B) {
    return !((A*B)%2);
}
