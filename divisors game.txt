Scooby has 3 three integers A, B and C.

Scooby calls a positive integer special if it is divisible by B and it is divisible by C. You need to tell number of special integers less than or equal to A.

int Solution::solve(int A, int B, int C) {
    /*_____Algorithm_______
    defination of lcm(B,C):Minimum number which is divisible by both B,C.
    
    */
    long int lcm=(B*C)/__gcd(B,C);
    return A/lcm;
}
