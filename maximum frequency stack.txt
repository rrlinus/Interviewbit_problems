Problem Description

You are given a matrix A which represent operations of size N x 2. Assume initially you have a stack-like data structure you have to perform operations on it.

Operations are of two types:

1 x: push an integer x onto the stack and return -1

2 0: remove and return the most frequent element in the stack.

If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.

A[i][0] describes the type of operation to be performed. A[i][1] describe the element x or 0 corresponding to the operation performed.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000

1 <= A[i][0] <= 2

0 <= A[i][1] <= 109



Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.



Output Format
Return the array of integers denoting answer to each operation.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [
            [1, 5]
            [1, 7]
            [1, 5]
            [1, 7]
            [1, 4]
            [1, 5]
            [2, 0]
            [2, 0]
            [2, 0]
            [2, 0]  ]
Input 2:

 A =  [   
        [1, 5]
        [2 0]
        [1 4]   ]


Example Output
Output 1:

 [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 5, 7, 5, 4]
Output 2:

 [-1, 5, -1]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Just simulate given operations
Explanation 2:
