Check if a string has all unique characters without using any additional data structure

solution:Here idea is to use bit masking as we know that maximum different types of characters here are 26 so.

we will take an integer of 32 bit and set it zero.

if any character like 'a' occures in the string then first we will check that the 0th bit is set or not if already set it means that 

we have already found this character and return false.

else set oth bit to 1.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    string s;
    cin>>s;
    int bit=0;
    for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
        int b=(s[i]-'a');
        if(bit &(1<<b)){
            return false;
        }
        bit |=(1<<b);
    }
    return true;
}
