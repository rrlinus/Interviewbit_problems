Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

A palindrome integer is an integer x for which reverse(x) = x where reverse(x) is x with its digit reversed. Negative numbers are not

.................Algorithm.......................

if a number is palindrome if and only if its reverse are same to the original

code:


int Solution::isPalindrome(int A) {
    int sum=0;
    int temp=A;
    while(temp){
        sum =sum*10+temp%10;
        temp/=10;
    }
    return A==sum and A>=0;
}
