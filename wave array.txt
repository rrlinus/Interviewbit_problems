Given an array of integers A, sort the array into a wave like array and return it, In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5.....

NOTE : If there are multiple answers possible, return the one that's lexicographically smallest.
vector<int> Solution::wave(vector<int> &A) {
    /*
      a1>=a2<=a3>=a4<=a5....
      since even elements is always less than or equall to even elements 
       
      this solution provide an answer in that order as the input order.
      let say x,y,z,w are the elements of the array.
      if x<=y then swap hence y>=x here x is now smaller than y
      y x z w
       
      if x>z then swap x<=z since x is already smaller so after swapping agin satisy their condition.
      
      
      if you want lexixographically order then first sort the input array then apply all the above conditions.

    int n=A.size();
    sort(A.begin(),A.end());
    for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
        if(i%2==0){
            if(A[i]<=A[i+1]){
                swap(A[i],A[i+1]);
            }
        }
        else{
            if(A[i]>=A[i+1]){
                swap(A[i],A[i+1]);
            }
        }
    }
    return A;
