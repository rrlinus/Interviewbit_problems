Max Non Negative SubArray
Given an array of integers, A of length N, find out the maximum sum sub-array of non negative numbers from A.

The sub-array should be contiguous i.e., a sub-array created by choosing the second and fourth element and skipping the third element is invalid.

Maximum sub-array is defined in terms of the sum of the elements in the sub-array.

Find and return the required subarray.

NOTE:

    1. If there is a tie, then compare with segment's length and return segment which has maximum length.
    2. If there is still a tie, then return the segment with minimum starting index.


Input Format:

The first and the only argument of input contains an integer array A, of length N.
Output Format:

Return an array of integers, that is a subarray of A that satisfies the given conditions.
Constraints:

1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e5
Examples:

Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 5, -7, 2, 3]

Output 1:
    [1, 2, 5]

Explanation 1:
    The two sub-arrays are [1, 2, 5] [2, 3].
    The answer is [1, 2, 5] as its sum is larger than [2, 3].

Input 2:
    A = [10, -1, 2, 3, -4, 100]

Output 2:
    [100]

Explanation 2:
    The three sub-arrays are [10], [2, 3], [100].
    The answer is [100] as its sum is larger than the other two.

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def maxset(self, A):
        sum1=0
        sum2=0
        max1=-677
        l=[]
        l1=[]
        for i in A:
            if i>=0:
                l.append(i)
                sum1+=i
            else:
                if sum1>max1:
                    l1=l.copy()
                    l=[]
                    max1=sum1
                    sum1=0
                else:
                    sum1=0
                
                    l=[]
        if sum1>max1:
            return l
        else:
            
            return l1
