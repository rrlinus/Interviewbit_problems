You are given 2 numbers P and Q.

An operation on these 2 numbers is defined as follows: Take the smaller number of the 2 numbers and subtract it from the bigger number. Keep performing this operation till either of the following criterion is met:

Both numbers become equal.
Either of the number becomes 0.
Find the sum of the final values of P and Q.

int Solution::getFinal(int A, int B) {
    
    /* .........Algorithm............
     A,B suppose A>B.
     A-B=C;
     A=B+C;
     let say k be the number which divides both.
     since A%k=0 hence (A+C)%k=0;
     which is gcd(A,B)=k;
     Note: When A==B we will substract one from other then finally we will get (A,0).
    */
    if(A==0 or B==0){
        return A+B;
    }
    return 2*__gcd(A,B)
}
